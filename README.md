# LSTM
 
A basic LSTM network can be build from scracth with just a few hundred lines of code in R. My motivation for doing this project, was that I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the inner operations of LSTM networks. It was the blog post by [@Manik9](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-architecture-of-lstm-cell-from-scratch-with-code-8da40f0b71f4) that sparked my interest, and it based on the his python implementation that I build this project.
